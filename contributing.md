This guide is designed to help you make small changes to TGClaw, even if you haven't written any code before! While it doesn't get into too much detail, it's a great starting point if you aren't sure where to begin. In this example, we're going to give the camp follower an extra healing powder, but you can go ahead and try with an idea of your own.

## Getting Set Up

1. Make a GitHub account: https://github.com/join
2. Go to https://github.com/BadDeathclaw/TG-Claw and click the Fork button in the upper right. This creates your own personal copy of the code.
3. Download and install GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/ , then sign in with the account you just made.
4. On the Configure Git page, click Continue - the defaults are fine. Finish the setup.
5. Click Clone A Repository and select your copy of TG-Claw (e.g. rhicora/TG-Claw). Await the download!
6. Now you can open up File Explorer and see your copy of TG-Claw, most likely at C:\Users\Admin\Documents\GitHub\TG-Claw

Congrats! You're all set up to contribute!

## Making Changes

1. In GitHub Desktop, click the Repository menu and click Pull to get the latest TG-Claw.
2. In that same menu, click New Branch to create a branch - a group of changes you're planning to make. 
3. Name it something easily understandable, like `give-followers-extra-powder`.
4. Open the files you want to edit in some form of editor; it's up to you! Dream Maker itself works (double click tgstation.dme), but we also recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
5. Type the changes you want; maybe you want the servants to start with extra healing powder (legion.dm)
6. Save your work (CTRL-S). Now that you have made your change, it's time to commit it!
7. In the lower left corner of GitHub Desktop, write a short message describing the individual change. Click the button that says Commit To...
8. In the Repository menu, click Push to send your changes back to GitHub.
9. In the Branch menu, click Create Pull Request. You'll see a full comparison of your changes vs. official TG-Claw.
10. Click the big green button to propose the code change!

Don't worry, it gets much faster after you do it a few times. If you get stuck, just ping @Scribes in Discord. We're happy to help you through.
